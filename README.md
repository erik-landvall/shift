## What is this
This is a javascript framework ment to work as an arktiekture frame. I started
designing this when I noticed that my frontend coding sometimes ended
up like a bowl of spagetti when the projects grew.

**Shift is under construction and will not have a good description until I have
a release candidate**  
*- no estimated time at this moment when a release candidate will be published* 

## Current version
Beta
